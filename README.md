## Overview
dnsaddr is a protocol that instructs the resolver to lookup multiaddr(s) in DNS TXT records for the domain name in it's value section.

This package adds the ability to resolves multiaddr's of the form 

```Swift
// Given multiaddr that uses the DNSADDR protocol
let ma = Multiaddr("/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmQCU2EcMqAqQPR2i9bChDtGNJchTbq5TbXJJ16u19uLTa")

// Resolving it by calling app.resolve
let resolvedAddresses = app.resolve(multiaddr: ma).wait()

// Yeilds a list of ip addresses that we can dial
// /ip4/139.178.91.71/tcp/4001/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN
// /ip6/2604:1380:45e3:6e00::1/tcp/4001/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN
// ...
// /ip4/139.178.91.71/udp/4001/quic-v1/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN
```

```Swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p-dnsaddr.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
    ],
    ...
        .target(
            ...
            dependencies: [
                ...
                .product(name: "LibP2PDNSAddr", package: "swift-libp2p-dnsaddr"),
            ]),
    ...
)
```

## Usage

```Swift
import LibP2PDNSAddr

/// Add the resolver to the applications resolver list. 
app.resolvers.use(.dnsaddr)

/// Or explicitly set your preferred dns resolver
let cloudflareDNS = try SocketAddress(ipAddress: "1.1.1.1", port: 53)
app.resolvers.use(.dnsaddr(host: cloudflareDNS))

/// From here on, when the application encounters a dnsaddr address it will use this package to attempt to resolve it.
